# Firebase Alibay backend

So far we've only been using firebase-admin from browser javascript using the firebase npm package.

To speed up development, we're going to be using firebase from NodeJS using the firebase-admin npm package.

## Instructions

Install the firebase-admin package

```npm install --save firebase-admin```

And you'll need to setup firebase in your project

## Giving your code to the front end developers

The front end developers will not be using the firebase-admin package. Instead, they will use the firebase package we're used to.
